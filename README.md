# CSES-Linters-Formatters-Hooks

## Linters, Formatters, and CI/CD with Husky

## 1. Introduction  
In modern development, three tools form the backbone of code quality:  

- **Linters**: Analyze code for errors, anti-patterns, and maintainability.  
- **Formatters**: Keep code style consistent across teams.  
- **Git hooks / CI/CD**: Automate checks before committing and deploying.  

These tools together create a development environment where developers can focus on logic instead of style disputes or late bug catching.

## 2. Why Theyâ€™re Important  
- **Consistency**: Enforces the same style across all contributors.  
- **Error prevention**: Detects bugs early (before runtime).  
- **Productivity**: No time wasted on formatting debates.  
- **Reliability**: Prevents bad code from slipping into `main`.
